# Object Detection Project with Python

Welcome to the Object Detection project using Python. This project utilizes various Python frameworks to perform object detection using the MobileNet SSD model. The project demonstrates how to set up, train, and deploy an object detection model for recognizing objects in images.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To detect and classify objects in images using MobileNet SSD with Python frameworks.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, MobileNet SSD, Coffee (if referring to a specific framework or tool)
- **Features**: Object detection, image processing, real-time detection

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Utilize MobileNet SSD for detecting objects in images.
- **Image Processing**: Preprocess images for better detection performance.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implement real-time object detection with live video input.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed. Download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Python Packages**: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy
